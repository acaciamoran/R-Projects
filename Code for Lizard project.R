#The Shapiro-Wilk Test tests the null hypothesis that the samples come 
#from a normal distribution vs. the alternative hypothesis that the 
#samples do not come from a normal distribution. In this case, the 
#p-value of the test is 3.292e-08, which is less than the alpha level of 0.05. 
#This suggests that the samples do not come from a normal distribution.
#However, because we have such a large sample size it is ok that this assumption
#is violated.

#Assumption 1
#Points 610, 646, and 754 are detected as outliers, which can severely affect normality 
#and homogeneity of variance. So we will try removing them from the data set.

#Bartlettâ€™s Test tests the null hypothesis that the samples have equal variances 
#vs. the alternative hypothesis that the samples do not have equal variances. 
#I ran the data with the outliers removed and without them removed and it did not
#make a difference as the assumption was still violated.
#In this case, the p-value of the test is <2.2e-16, which is less than the alpha 
#level of 0.05. This suggests that the samples do not all have equal variances.
#Since we have the sampl sample size in each microhabitat it is ok that 
#the equal variance assumption is violated.

#Assumption 3
#The observations in each group are independent of the observations in every 
#other group and that the observations within each group were obtained by a 
#random sample.
#We will assume here that the observations are independent and that one measuremet
#of temperature did not effect the other microhabitat temperatures.
#While she dd not ramdomly pick locations for placing the piece to measure the 
#temperature, she did say she walked around placing them. So we will proceed
#with caution.
